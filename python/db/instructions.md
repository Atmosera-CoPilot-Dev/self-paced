# Python exercise 2

- This exercise will let you practice using Copilot with Python. 
- You will build out a simple program that models the 'album' table in the 'recordings' database as defined in the 'recordings.sql' file.
- The database is a MySQL database and the Python program will use the 'mysql-connector-python' library to interact with the database.
- The application must be object-oriented and use sqlAlchemy to support ORM
- These instructions assume you have Python 3 installed. You can use any OS you choose (OS X, Windows,or Linux).

## Tips
- Use Copilot Chat to scaffold the Python code.
- Use Copilot to help you modify the Python code. 
- Be sure to test your code as you go.
